# PEQN CNF Submodule Examples

A pure CNF encoder functionality, you can use with any solver that support the standard output of SAT Races, for online use with Jupyter Notebooks use the standard mode http://www.peqnp.com.


##### Note: To install PEQNP without builtin solvers to use with pre-build solvers that implement PEQNP_API or use with pure CNF submodule install with:
    
    pip install PEQNP==2.1.16 --install-option=no-solver --upgrade 
     
##### Note: Performance depend on SAT Solver, try any solver from http://www.satcompetition.org  

# Main Differences

    import peqnp.cnf as cnf
    
    cnf.begin(bits=7, key='my_problem')
    x = cnf.integer()
    _2 = cnf.constant(2) # Note: create_constant on standard functionality
    assert 2 ** x == 128
    cnf.end({'x': x}) # for vector see multiset_reconstruction_by_differences.py
    while cnf.satisfy(solver='path_to_my_sat_race_sat_solver', params='some params to solver'):
        peinr(x) 

# BLUE
 A Powerful and Portable SAT Solver for Java https://github.com/maxtuno/blue
 
 very simple:
 
 java -jar -Xmx4g blue.jar file.cnf
 
Blue is based on Minisat many thanks to Niklas Een, Niklas Sorensson for this great solver.
