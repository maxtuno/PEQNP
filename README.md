# SLIME 4 SAT Solver 

Sat Competition 2020, 3rd place on Cloud Tack, https://satcompetition.github.io/2020/results.html

### Note: (https://twitter.com/maxtuno)

#SLIME 5 slow at the beginning, but this cost is paid in solved problems, solve 30 more SAT instances than Kissat, however, for the CNFs that #PEQNP generates, it does not present great advantages, so tomorrow I will put SLIME 4 that solve the 1250x625 Queen Completion Problem...
