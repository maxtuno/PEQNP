# NP-Complete Problems

NP-complete problem, any of a class of computational problems for which no efficient solution algorithm has been found. Many significant computer-science problems belong to this classâ€”e.g., the traveling salesman problem, satisfiability problems, and graph-covering problems.

# Satisfiability

Study of boolean functions generally is concerned with the set of truth assignments (assignments of 0 or 1 to each of the variables) that make the function true.
