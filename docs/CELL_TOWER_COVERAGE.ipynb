    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A telecommunications company needs to build a set of mobile phone towers to provide signal coverage to the inhabitants of a given city. Several potential locations have been identified where the towers could be built. The towers have a fixed range and due to budget restrictions, only a limited number of them can be built. Given these restrictions, the company wants to provide coverage to the largest possible percentage of the population. To simplify the problem, the company has divided the area it wants to cover into a set of regions, each of which has a known population. The objective is then to choose in which of the potential locations the company should build cell phone towers, to provide coverage to as many people as possible. "
